# sumOfDiagonals
Write a function that accepts a two dimensional matrix and returns the sum of the two diagonals.
* The matrix should be a square matrix(equal number of rows and columns).
* You can use only one loop.
For eg. [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
         
         
Sum of the two diagonals=1+5+9+3+5+7=30
Output =30

For eg. [[-1,-2],
         [ 3, 4]]
Sum of the two diagonals=-1+4-2+3=4
Output=4

For eg. [[1]].
Output=1
