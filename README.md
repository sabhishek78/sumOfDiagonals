# Sum of Diagonals of a Square Matrix
Write a function that accepts a two dimensional matrix and returns the sum of the two diagonals.
* The matrix should be a square matrix(equal number of rows and columns).
* You can use only one loop.<br>
  For eg. <br>
  [[1,2,3],<br>
         [4,5,6],<br>
         [7,8,9]]
         
         
  Sum of the two diagonals=1+5+9+3+5+7=30
  <br>
  Output =30

  For eg.<br> [[-1,-2],<br>
              [ 3, 4]]
         <br>
  Sum of the two diagonals=-1+4-2+3=4
  <br>
  Output=4
  <br>

  For eg.<br> [[1]].
  <br>
  Output=1
